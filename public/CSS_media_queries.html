<p>Resize the browser window. When the width of this document is 500pixels or less, the background-color is "lightblue", otherwise it is "lightgreen".  --run this in the browser, and it will change the background color on any screen that's 500 pixels or less to blue. This is one way of changing the layout on a cellphone.</p>

"Reading diet books won't make you thin. Reading exercise books won't make you fit. Reading libertarian books won't make you free. If you want small government and freedom, you must act. Not just once. Regularly, repeatedly, relentlessly."
