<h4>U.S. Politics: the Dunning-Kruger Electorate and Sociopathic Politicians</h4>
<p>
Prior to 2018, the <i>system</i> of "The United States Libertarian Party" (and the Garrisonian abolitionists in the middle 1830s and 1840s) did not care enough about individual freedom to learn how to win. (The highest offices the U.S. Libertarian Party has ever won were simultaneously 4/40 seats in the Alaska State Legislature, from 1978 to 1982. One man with above-average strategic political comprehension and electability masterminded this victory -Dick Randolph.) Since their victory in Alaska, the U.S. Libertarian Party has won 9 city council seats in the suburbs of Detroit (also the work of a small, 3-person team that was masterminded and financed by one man -Greg Dirasian, followed by Barb Goushaw and Fred Collins), and 4/400 State Legislative seats in New Hampshire (an even less significant achievement, but again, led by one man: Don Gorman). To make winning the New Hampshire legislative seats(prior to the Free State Project!) seem like a significant victory, the National Libertarian Party and Free State Project would always (intellectually dishonestly) fail to mention that New Hampshire has 400 super-tiny state legislative districts, and that the limiting variable in achieving control of the NH State Legislature is the number and "district dispersal" of electable, small-L libertarians. (For this reason, New Hampshire was a terrible choice for the "anarcho-zionist" "Free State Project.")

<p>More importantly, libertarians who wish to obtain the minimum knowledge necessary to create a high measure of individual freedom should directly interface with the system that directly causes and perpetuates tyranny. They should do so in a way that directly reduces the power that tyranny has. They should go out and register 100 new libertarians into their local Libertarian Party. If they cannot do this, then they should absolutely never criticize those who can.</p>
<p>Even in pro-tyranny environments, with no other initiatives or referenda to use as a "stopper petition," I was able to register a minimum of 25 new libertarians per day. Most of the people the Libertarian Party employs refuse to do this job, and *cannot* do it. This is for 2 reasons: (1) Because most people the LP hires are hired solely to gather petition signatures that place the Party on the ballot for one election cycle, as opposed to gathering "voter registrations" that, cumulatively above a threshold, cause the LP to be permanently on the ballot in a given state. and, (2) Because the Libertarian Party's "ballot access director"(and overall "decider of all things of importance; allocator of 90%+ of the LP's money") purposefully employs mindless "socialist-by-default" petitioners from California's initiative petitioning industry, in order to sow disloyalty, dissent, and chaos into the liberty movement. This has become a regular and recurring feature of every petition drive, where activists suddenly find out that their plans to remain in a certain area for another two weeks or month are now suddenly canceled, as monies that had been promised allocated to them on a payment-upon-delivery-basis by the State Party have been wired by the National Party to their vastly-less-skilled competition.</p>
<p>The prior description of a commonplace means of creating chaos in a controlled political entity, while maintaining "plausible deniability" is a rather sophisticated form of political technology. Infiltration and subversion of the liberty movement provides the enemy with a vastly greater measure of control than each side simply "arguing their best points before the media." Even so, there are possible counter-measures that the liberty movement is capable of. Sadly, these counter-measures are not being implemented, and there is no desire to hold ourselves to a standard that is capable of implementing them. ...And this is why the liberty movement in the USA is moribund, useless, and ineffectual. ...And that, in turn, is why there is no liberty in the USA.</p>
<p>By arguing that libertarianism cannot succeed except by the introduction of some new amazing technology (blockchains, seasteading, etc.), libertarians ignore the only technology that has ever resulted in an increase in individual freedom: <i>political technology</i> (as defined in the prior linked essay by Morton Blackwell, "The Real Nature of Politics").</p>
