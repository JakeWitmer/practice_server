      <h3>Equality Under the Law</h3>
      <h5>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are.</h5>
      <p>The law must not deny benefits that it confers to anyone, nor allow anyone to escape punishment that it might impose on anyone. This principle, throughout history, has tended to turn the people (with whom all true power resides) against the wealthy and powerful whenever the wealthy and powerful are given special privileges under the law that are denied to the poor and weak. This tendency first became prevalent when "the levellers," led by John "Freeborn John" Lilburne, significantly reduced the power of royalty in England, in the mid-1600s. The levellers sought to elevate serfs to the same level of legal property protections that the nobles enjoyed, and sought to reduce the ability of nobles and royalty to impose their will on others to the same level as the common elector, converting "inferior-under-the-law subjects" to "equal-under-the-law citizens."</p>
      <p> Contained within this principle is that those who are mighty or wealthy are not treated better, or made more able to manipulate the law, in any way, than the weakest or poorest citizen. This implies both strong democratic limits on government power (proper jury trials; a universally acknowledged right of habeas corpus) and weak democratic limits on government power (proper elections in which all parties have access to the ballot). Also contained within this principle is a rejection of false authority, which can be defined as "any authority which is not voluntarily acknowledged and accepted, by the judgment of those who accept it."</p>
      <p>There can be no royalty or "divine right of kings" when everyone is treated equally under the law. Furthermore, if everyone must be treated equally under the law, then anyone who calls attention to unequal treatment under the law must be taken seriously, and his claims investigated. If this happens, the law will tend to correct errors in its construction, administration, and maintenance, over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Prohibition of Coercion</h3>
      <h5>This is sometimes called "the golden rule" or "the non-aggression principle," and it prohibits the initiation of coercion(force, or the realistic threat of force) among human beings.</h5>
      <p>Early formulations of "prohibitions on the initiation of coercion" were religious commandments which were a precursor to philosophy, from which philosophy evolved. Foremost among them, "the golden rule"("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.") Thomas Paine, in a communication with Father Ray Suarez clarified this rule by adding its corollary, "the silver rule"("Don't do unto others what you don't want done to yourself."), which eliminated an ambiguity that had been exploited by sophists in the service of totalitarian rulers. (Prior to this advancement, authoritarian sophists successfully proclaimed that, because they didn't want to engage in vices personally, others should be harshly punished for doing so, because if they desired to engage in those vices, they would want themselves to be harshly punished. Realistically, this fails several tests of logical scrutiny, and should be rejected on moral and rational grounds.)</p>
      <p>Implicit in this idea is that taxation, to be moral, must be voluntary. If one judges the alleged "services" of government to be worthless, one must not be forced to pay for them. If a government cannot exist on voluntary support of its electorate, then it probably isn't a very good government. This view eliminates the argument between honest anarchists and honest minarchists. Both are fighting for the same thing: to eliminate the coercive powers of government. If people wish to pay taxes and participate in elections, they may do so, to determine how the police powers are to be allocated toward the investigation of crime and disincentivization or neutralization of various criminal threats.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Freedom of Speech</h3> 
      <h5>Without the freedom to communicate the pro-freedom ideas on this page, these ideas will tend to die out, over time.</h5>
      <p>Without active debate about how to best communicate pro-freedom ideas, and how best to prioritize their implementation, these ideas will fail to be phrased in such a way that they can be understood, and will fail to spread throughout society. The reason for this is that these ideas are dangerous to tyrants, so tyrants try to interfere with the teaching of them by knowledgeable adherents. If they can do that, only inept adherents and communicators will remain. Inept defenders of ideas discredit those ideas.</p>
      <p>The prior point about inept adherents is very important. One inept way of spreading ideas is to never place them into political contests that vye for political power. This signals to the poorly-educated (a majority of all electorates, worldwide, in 2017) that those ideas are not important enough to implement in material reality. After all, if our philosophical ideas are good and true, then we owe it to ourselves to implement our philosophy. Since King Charles I attempted to silence John Milton and the The English Levellers, and his successors tried to silence the Quaker religion and jury rights activists, political powers have tried to selectively silence freedom of communication while dishonestly claiming to support it.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it is of vital importance that every area that is open to the general public as a foot-traffic thoroughfare, and not used for some specialized purpose that requires the silence of all (such as a theater or library), be considered "open to free speech." Said another way: All of America is a "free speech zone," and the desire to limit free speech to "special zones," (outside of which, free speech is presumably to be violently opposed by armed police), is completely un-American and tyrannical. Because universities, in particular, have continuously tried to claim that petitioners and activists must be silenced or arrested until "approved,"(by which time, legally-binding petitioning periods have often passed their ballot access deadlines) or relegated to "free speech zones" (where there are too few people to hear them, or too few people to gather enough signatures for a political petition to be legally-binding), in order to suppress political speech, the claims of universities and public institutions to be capable of legitimately deciding where speech should be allowed should be viewed, by default, with both suspicion and contempt. A good heuristic or "general rule" is "if people can walk there, people can talk there."</p>
      <p> The work of "free speech absolutist" activists like Harvey Silverglate and Alan Charles Kors in "opening up universities" (to all viewpoints!) should be vigorously supported, as should the political free speech absolutist agenda of their organization, "the FIRE"(the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education).</p>
    </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Civil Disobedience</h3> 
      <h5>Laws that violate individual rights are unconstitutional and should be disobeyed. Those who break illegitimate laws are doing us all a favor by risking their own safety and comfort to stand against those laws, and we should all help them escape state punishment.</h5>
      <p>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are. When governments fail to uphold equality under the law, those who are treated unfairly can continue to obey the law, or they can break the law in an attempt to force the government to reconsider the cost of enforcing the unjust law. This idea was first consistently put forward in America by Henry David Thoreau and Lysander Spooner, who opposed the many unconstitutional laws of the 1800s. Thoreau wrote the political and philosophical masteripiece "Resistance to Civil Government"(later retitled "On Civil Disobedience"), and Spooner wrote the legal theory essays "The Unconstitutionality of Slavery" and "An Essay On the Trial by Jury." Frederick Douglass was a great political popularizer of the prior ideas, and he fought and won political battles to extend individual rights protections to then-enslaved black Americans, and abolitionist whites in the North. (He was also the author of an autobiography and many political speeches, who wrote about his experience escaping from slavery.) After the Civil War, Douglass fought to enforce those rights-protections against a still-racist Southern majority that had instituted local "Jim Crow" laws designed to target the newly-freed former slaves for legal persecution and denial of democratic participation. Thoreau encouraged the breaking of all unjust laws, no matter their extent. This concept has come to be called "civil disobedience." Civil disobedience, used in conjunction with jury independence, is the decentralization of political power that gave rise to western civilization.</p>
      <p>Because laws exist that violate individual rights, due to the power-seeking of legislators and lack of education among the electorate(which fails to hold them accountable), two schools of thought have emerged. The status quo school suggests meekly obeying unjust laws until legislators develop the will to change them. But this theory of "representation" fails over time, because those who seek and win political power are usually power-seeking sociopaths. No system has ever been well-designed enough to keep power-seeking sociopaths from winning political power. Thoreau, Spooner, and Douglass instead suggested that no individual is obligated to obey an unjust law, and that juries ought to acquit individuals who break unjust laws. This concept was named "jury nullification of law" by "bar-licensed attorneys," and has come to be called "jury independence" by common Americans. Because bar-licensing violates the principle of "equality under the law," bar-licensing itself can be explained as a criminal conspiracy of like-minded tyrants.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Jury Independence</h3> 
      <h5>Jury independence is the highest power citizens possess, and the strongest form of "civic participation"; it is the right to directly <i>nullify</i> unjust government laws by returning a "not guilty" verdict. This prevents those laws from being enforced.</h5> 
      <p>Because not all laws are unjust, this concept is called "jury independence" because jurors can choose to apply or <i>uphold</i> proper(moral, just, legitimate, constitutional) government laws, according to (1) the context in which the agents of the government seek to apply them AND (2) one's own personal conscience.</p>
      <p>Elitist bar-licensed lawyers ("attorneys") call "jury independence" by the name "jury nullification of law" because they know that this name is confusing to most non-lawyers, since it tends to get shortened to "jury nullification" making it sound like the jury itself is what is being nullified. Via an organized political campaign of obfuscation, bar-licensed attorneys, politicians, and government schoolteachers have diminished public knowledge among citizen-jurors of our right to "jury independence." In any case where the state is seeking to punish an innocent person for a non-crime, it makes a lot of sense to pretend to be obedient and servile (so you are not removed from the jury in the pre-trial questioning process known as "voir dire"), and then return a verdict of "not guilty" with no explanation. (Even after the pre-trial screening process, you can now be removed from the jury and replaced with an "alternate juror," <i>especially</i> even if you don't directly contradict what you said during "voir dire.") However, prosecutors and judges cannot force you to accept that the prosecutor is telling the truth. The solution is simply to be a holdout "not guilty" vote, and refuse to explain your verdict, even if it "hangs the jury."</p>
      <p>Most people have no problem with enforcing laws against rape, robbery, murder, and assault. The prior laws all have a "corpus" comprised of "injury" and "intent to injure" the same individual or small group of injured individuals with a specific act. The same is not true when government itself becomes the victimizer, and claims to act on specious theories of "the greater good of society." "Society" has no feelings and can't be an injured party. The idea that government puts drug users in prison "for their own good" is idiotic, irrational, cruel, and unscientific. Destroying someone's life with years in prison to prevent him or her from recreationally using safer-than-alcohol plant drugs is destructive malevolence. At the root of most government crime is simple theft: Government steals money and property from the people it imprisons. It makes examples of the few to scare the many into compliance with unjust laws. Such laws operate on the principle that it's the government's job to prevent harm. This is not true (and not possible): it's the government's job to protect individual rights by dispensing commensurate retaliatory force so that individuals aren't incentivized toward vigilantism.

  <h1>Restoring Individual Freedom</h1>
  <H4>Here are 12 ways that you can help restore jury independence, and with it, American freedom:</H4> 
</div> 
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(1) Personally "nullify the law" by voting "not guilty," if called to serve on a jury in a "victimless (non-)crime" case.</b> Make sure you get seated on the jury by answering the "voir dire" questions like an unthinking conformist (if you go first), or the "as similarly as possible" to the way the rest of the jurors answer the questions (if you are questioned after the others). State your willingness to apply the law if the defendant is guilty, but only if directly asked. Don't volunteer <i>any</i> information! Once you're seated on the jury, if it's a victimless non-crime, simply be a holdout "not guilty" vote, and <i>don't explain your vote to anyone</i>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(2) Support the abolition of the unconstitutional practice of "voir dire" pre-trial questioning.</b> The practice of "voir dire" was instituted as a means of punishing runaway slaves. It has no legitimacy in any system of limited government power. Today, voir dire is used to stack the jury full of mindless conformists who support the drug war, so they can continue to send impoverished voting minorities to for-profit prisons. Voir dire is simply a way to allow the prosecutors and judges to conspire against defendants and stack the jury so their threats have weight behind them. In states that have the citizen-sponsored initiative process, initiatives that abolish voir dire should be sponsored and voted into law by the public.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(3) Support the total abolition of the government schools.</b> Encourage parents to home-school and to teach their children about jury independence by requiring their kids to read Clay Conrad's book "Jury Nullification: The Evolution of a Doctrine." The government schools have created an uneducated Jury. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(4) Support the reinstatement of proper jury-instruction language. </b> Prior to the year 1895, in every local county courthouse in America, judges would instruct jurors in criminal cases this way: "You, the citizens of the state of ____, have a right to vote your consciences, even if your consciences be in direct disagreement with the law. You you understand?" Those who said "No," were not considered to be mentally-competent enough to be jurors, given a proper understanding of Civics. The courts now substitute the following <i>question</i> in place of the old instruction: "Can you, the citizens of the state of ____, agree to apply the law, as I give it to you?" Those answering "Yes" are essentially admitting to morally abnegating their duty as jurors. Let's return to the proper pre-trial instructions that once gave us the highest standard of living in the world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(5) Personally support the abolition of bar-licensing.</b> Prior to bar-licensing, lawyers were not incentivized to act as though "all existing laws are legitimate," and many defense attorneys encouraged "jury nullification of law" in defense of their clients. We should return to that state of affairs. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(6) Personally support the restoration of the Freedom of Speech inside courts of law.</b> Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of reinstating freedom of speech inside the courtroom by outlawing judicial gag orders known as "motions in limine,"(Pronounced "Motions in Lim-Uh-Nay") and support a change to the law that disallows any silencing of defense arguments selectively, based on their content.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="clearfix"></div>
      <br>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(7) Personally support strengthening the Constitution's existing ban on "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" in the USA (such punishment is already-prohibited by the 8th Amendment).</b> End the practice of high-stakes extortion using "cruel and unusual punishment," especially as resulting in undeserved prison sentences. If you are a juror in a court where the prior occurs, consider voting "not guilty" as a form of political protest. Demand that all information about prosecution-offered plea bargains be admissible by the defense as constituting evidence of lack of a legitimate case, and an attempt at organized, criminal extortion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(8) Personally support banning "high-stakes plea bargains," and revisiting all cases where such were used to coerce acqiescence to undeserved punishments.</b> Consider supporting candidates who campaign on a platform of allowing a maximum punishment of a $100 fine or "civil court restitution to be paid to specific, named victims or those victims' next-of-kin or dependents" for all "plea bargains" where no human life was lost. Consider banning prison time for nonviolent offenses.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(9) Support reinstating the common practice of citizen-initiated Grand Jury Presentment.</b> Demand that Grand Juries are required to be opened to the general public, and made available to the general public for grand jury presentment, and support a change to the laws requiring the posting of the format for grand jury presentment on a public website, as well as requiring that the times when the grand jury is available to receive presentments from the general public be posted on a public website, and in front of the courthouse itself.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(10) Reinstate the proper right of "habeas corpus" and the requirement of a valid, 2-part criminal corpus("corpus delicti") in all criminal prosecutions.</b> If a 2-part "corpus" such cannot be produced at any time during the trial, or pretrial, require that the case be dismissed, all charges dropped, and the judge and prosecutor be held criminally liable for the violation of constitutionally-guaranteed, individual rights.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(11) Demand that judges, police, and prosecutors be held accountable for enabling the legalized criminal practices like "civil asset forfeiture," using organized <i>political</i> jury nullification.</b>  Support the campaigns of politicians who demand the abolition of criminal practices like "already-mislabeled criminal cases" renamed "civil asset forfeiture." Demand full restitution for the existing victims of "civil asset forfeiture" and other forms of State-legalized theft. Demand the instantiation of automatic protections that disallow the conflation of criminal charges with civil charges(such as by claiming that the "injured party" in a criminal case is "all of society"). The doctrine of claiming that "all of society" can be the "injured party" in a criminal case is Marxist legal theory. Judges, prosecutors, and police have slowly turned our capitalist constitutional republic into a totalitarian Marxist regime. We need to begin undoing the damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <p><b>(12) Threaten violent rebellion, if jury trials are denied or abolished. Without jury trials, there is no limit on government power, and we are then effectively living in a dictatorship.</b> The totalitarianism-desiring agents of the pathocratic state must know that the loss of jury trials will be understood to be an unacceptable "checkmate" that would certainly usher in a totalitarian regime. Buy a rifle, and learn how to shoot a dinner-plate at 100 yards.  We must send a strong message: "This far, but no further! Don't Tread On Me!"</p>

      <div class="col-md-11 col-md-offset-.5">
      <p>"We have it in our power to begin the world anew" -Thomas Paine</p>
      <p>The Constitution, though in many ways very good, was flawed from its inception. For example, it appeared to endorse slavery (if only by failing to condemn and outlaw it), due to the political expediency of needing to enlist the Southern pro-slavery states in the battle for basic survival. (The first goal of every cybernetic entity is self-preservation; if that goal fails, all sub-goals also fail. The goals of a system define the system, even if the pursuit of those goals appears incoherent. Chaotic action, subterfuge, dishonesty, trickery, camouflage, etc. can all appear to be abandonment of goal structures, when, in reality, they are adaptations to observation, monitoring, and tracking of the systems. Goal-structured systems give rise to counter-goal-structured systems, as per Norbert Weiner, J.B.S. Haldane, and W. Ross Ashby.) Even so, as long as jury trials existed, that was enough to reduce the power of the state via organized "civil disobedience" and corresponding "jury independence"(a political strategy of "organizing the Jury"). Once even 5% of jurors in a given "jury wheel" or "potential jury pool" disagree with a law <i>and</i> intend to nullify that law, that law becomes unenforceable. Further, the enforcement of that law then becomes self-defeating for prosecutors (who wish to maintain a high conviction rate). The way this "5%-makes-any-law-unenforceable" heuristic is calculated is by taking the percentage opposed to the law, as a decimal, subtracted from 1, and taken to the 12th power.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As one can see in the above chart, with even 5% opposed to a law and willing to nullify it, the odds of a prosecutor successfully convicting a breaker of that law are equal to: (.95^12) = (.5403) = approximately 54%. Prosecutors tend to drop charges against defendants when their odds of conviction drop below 60%, lest they lose public support and lose their jobs. In the past, the Alien and Sedition Laws, Fugitive Slave Law, Alcohol Prohibition Laws, and Unmarried Cohabitation Laws were all defeated this way: by organized efforts to inform the jury of their full power, and by educated jurors getting seated on juries and exercizing that power.</p>
