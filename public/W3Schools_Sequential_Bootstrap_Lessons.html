      <h3>Equality Under the Law</h3>
      <h5>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are.</h5>
      <p>The law must not deny benefits that it confers to anyone, nor allow anyone to escape punishment that it might impose on anyone. This principle, throughout history, has tended to turn the people (with whom all true power resides) against the wealthy and powerful whenever the wealthy and powerful are given special privileges under the law that are denied to the poor and weak. This tendency first became prevalent when "the levellers," led by John "Freeborn John" Lilburne, significantly reduced the power of royalty in England, in the mid-1600s. The levellers sought to elevate serfs to the same level of legal property protections that the nobles enjoyed, and sought to reduce the ability of nobles and royalty to impose their will on others to the same level as the common elector, converting "inferior-under-the-law subjects" to "equal-under-the-law citizens."</p>
      <p> Contained within this principle is that those who are mighty or wealthy are not treated better, or made more able to manipulate the law, in any way, than the weakest or poorest citizen. This implies both strong democratic limits on government power (proper jury trials; a universally acknowledged right of habeas corpus) and weak democratic limits on government power (proper elections in which all parties have access to the ballot). Also contained within this principle is a rejection of false authority, which can be defined as "any authority which is not voluntarily acknowledged and accepted, by the judgment of those who accept it."</p>
      <p>There can be no royalty or "divine right of kings" when everyone is treated equally under the law. Further more, if everyone must be treated equally under the law, then anyone who calls attention to unequal treatment under the law must be taken seriously, and his claims investigated. If this happens, the law will tend to correct errors in its construction and administration, over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Prohibition of Coercion</h3>
      <h5>This is sometimes called "the golden rule" or "the non-aggression principle," and it prohibits the initiation of coercion(force, or the realistic threat of force) among human beings.</h5>
      <p>Early formulations of "prohibitions on the initiation of coercion" were religious commandments which were a precursor to philosophy, from which philosophy evolved. Foremost among them, "the golden rule"("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.") Thomas Paine, in a communication with Father Ray Suarez clarified this rule by adding its corollary, "the silver rule"("Don't do unto others what you don't want done to yourself."), which eliminated an ambiguity that had been exploited by sophists in the service of totalitarian rulers. (Prior to this advancement, authoritarian sophists successfully proclaimed that, because they didn't want to engage in vices personally, others should be harshly punished for doing so, because if they desired to engage in those vices, they would want themselves to be harshly punished. Realistically, this fails several tests of logical scrutiny, and should be rejected on moral and rational grounds.)</p>
      <p>Implicit in this idea is that taxation, to be moral, must be voluntary. If one judges the alleged "services" of government to be worthless, one must not be forced to pay for them. If a government cannot exist on voluntary support of its electorate, then it probably isn't a very good government. This view eliminates the argument between honest anarchists and honest minarchists. Both are fighting for the same thing: to eliminate the coercive powers of government. If people wish to pay taxes and participate in elections, they may do so, to determine how the police powers are to be allocated toward the investigation of crime and disincentivization or neutralization of various criminal threats.</p>

    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Freedom of Speech</h3> 
      <h5>Without the freedom to communicate the pro-freedom ideas on this page, these ideas will tend to die out, over time.</h5>
      <p>Without active debate about how to best communicate pro-freedom ideas, and how best to prioritize their implementation, these ideas will fail to be phrased in such a way that they can be understood, and will fail to spread throughout society. The reason for this is that these ideas are dangerous to tyrants, so tyrants try to interfere with the teaching of them by knowledgeable adherents. If they can do that, only inept adherents and communicators will remain. Inept defenders of ideas discredit those ideas.</p>
      <p>The prior point about inept adherents is very important. One inept way of spreading ideas is to never place them into political contests that vye for political power. This signals to the poorly-educated (a majority of all electorates, worldwide, in 2017) that those ideas are not important enough to implement in material reality. After all, if one's philosophical ideas are good and true, then one owes it to himself to implement his philosophy. Since King Charles I attempted to silence John Milton, The English Levellers, and his successors tried to silence the Quaker religion and jury rights activists, political powers have tried to selectively silence freedom of communication while dishonestly claiming to support it.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it is of vital importance that every area that is open to the general public as a foot-traffic thoroughfare, and not used for some specialized purpose that requires the silence of all (such as a theater or library), be considered "open to free speech." Said another way: All of America is a "free speech zone," and the desire to limit free speech to "special zones," (outside of which, free speech is presumably to be violently opposed by armed police), is completely un-American and tyrannical. Because universities, in particular, have continuously tried to claim that petitioners and activists must be silenced or arrested until "approved,"(by which time, legally-binding petitioning periods have often passed their ballot access deadlines) or relegated to "free speech zones" (where there are too few people to hear them, or too few people to gather enough signatures for a political petition to be legally-binding), in order to suppress political speech, the claims of universities and public institutions to be capable of legitimately deciding where speech should be allowed should be viewed, by default, with both suspicion and contempt. A good heuristic or "general rule" is "if people can walk there, people can talk there."</p>
      <p> The work of "free speech absolutist" activists like Harvey Silverglate and Charles Alan Kors in "opening up universities" (to all viewpoints!) should be vigorously supported, as should the political free speech absolutist agenda of their organization, "the FIRE"(the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education).</p>
    </div>
      <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Civil Disobedience</h3> 
      <h5>Laws that violate individual rights are unconstitutional and should be disobeyed. Those who break illegitimate laws are doing us all a favor by risking their own safety and comfort to stand against those laws, and we should all help them escape state punishment.</h5>
      <p>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are. This idea was first put forward by both Henry David Thoreau and Lysander Spooner, who opposed the many already-existing unconstitutional laws of the 1800s. Thoreau wrote the political/philosophical "Resistance to Civil Government"(later retitled "On Civil Disobedience"), and Spooner wrote the legal theory essays "The Unconstitutionality of Slavery" and "An Essay on the Trial By Jury." Frederick Douglass was a great political popularizer of the prior ideas, and he fought and won the political battle to extend individual rights protections to then-enslaved black Americans, and the whites in the North who were a part of the resistance to slavery. After the Civil War, Douglass fought to enforce those rights protections against a still-racist Southern majority that had instituted local "Jim Crow" laws designed to target the newly-freed former slaves for legal persecution and denial of democratic participation. Thoreau, in his own way, encouraged the breaking of all pro-slavery laws, no matter their extent. This concept has come to be called "civil disobedience," and it is the foundation of western civilization that tests and breaks the unjust machinery of government, whenever it appears.</p>
      <p>Because laws exist that violate individual rights, due to the power-seeking of legislators and the lack of education of the electorate that fails to hold them accountable, two schools of thought have emerged. Thoreau, Spooner, and Douglass suggested that no individual is obligated to obey an unjust law, and that juries ought to acquit individuals who break unjust laws. This concept is called "jury nullification of law" by the organized totalitarian conspiracy called "bar-licensed attorneys," and "jury independence" by common American citizen-jurors. Because bar-licensing violates the principle of "equality under the law," by affording licensed attorneys special treatment by criminal courts that are denied to pro-se defendants (and their allies), bar-licensing is best seen as an unconstitutional tyranny.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Jury Independence</h3> 
      <h5>Jury independence is the highest power citizens possess; it is the right to directly <i>nullify</i> unjust government laws by returning a "not guilty" verdict.</h5> 
      <p>Because not all laws are unjust, this concept is called "jury independence" because jurors can choose to apply or <i>uphold</i> just/moral/legitimate/constitutional government laws, according to (1) the context in which the agents of the government seek to apply them AND (2) one's own personal, independent, moral judgment or "right of conscience." Elitist bar-licensed lawyers ("attorneys") call "jury independence" by the name "jury nullification of law" because they know that this name is confusing to most non-lawyers, because it tends to get shortened down to "jury nullification" making it sound like the jury itself is what is being nullified. Via an organized political campaign of obfuscation, bar-licensed attorneys, politicians, and government schoolteachers have diminished public knowledge among citizen-jurors of the right to exercise "jury independence." In a drug case, gun case, tax-nonpayment case, prostitution case, or other case where the state is seeking to punish an innocent person for a non-crime, it makes a lot of sense to pretend to be obedient and servile (so you are not removed from the jury in the pre-trial questioning process known as "voir dire"), and then return a verdict of "not guilty" with no explanation. (Even after the pre-trial screening process, you can now be removed from the jury and replaced with an "alternate juror," <i>especially</i> if you directly contradict what you said during "voir dire." However, the prosecutors and judges cannot force you to accept that the prosecutor is telling the truth (if they could, the jury wouldn't even deliberate, the judge would simply command them to return a certain verdict, as the "courts of star chamber" once did, in England, prior to 1638). The solution is simply to be a holdout "not guilty" vote, and refuse to explain your verdict, even if it "hangs the jury.")</p>
      <p>Prosecutors, judges, police, and authoritarian schoolteachers typically wish to mislead the public into believing that "every law is legitimate," and "every law should be enforced." This is because such people tend to be lazy sociopaths who were incapable of becoming engineers and building useful technology. Because this is the case, they often tend to resent productive people, and have decided to band together to use government power to steal from the rest of productive society. The cops who attack, arrest, and testify against innocent property owners are "in on the conspiracy," or, at very least, "too stupid and servile to oppose it." Additionally, sociopaths who lack empathy for their fellow man tend not to mind if the rights of their fellow man are violated, and if people are divided into "victims" and "victimizers," they prefer to be the latter. For all of the prior reasons, the system has been thoroughly corrupted, and reasonable people should take every opportunity to act in a way contrary to what the system desires. The strongest way possible to do this, in the what little remains of the American system of government, is to return a "not guilty" verdict.</p>
      <p>There are seven major ways that you can fight to restore jury independence. The first way is <b>(1) Directly and personally pursue the outcome of jury independence, if called to serve on a jury.</b> Make sure you get seated on the jury by answering the "voir dire" questions like an unthinking conformist (if you go first), or the "most similar possible" to the way the rest of the jurors answer the questions (if you are questioned after the others). State your willingness to apply the law if the defendant is guilty, but only if directly asked. Don't volunteer <i>any</i>information! ...just try to answer the questions as close to the way everyone else does. Judges want servile conformists on the jury. Don't follow those who grandstand and say they know their rights, etc. Be smarter than the prosecutors who try to suppress jury independence! Once you're seated on the jury, if it's a victimless non-crime, simply vote "not guilty," and do not explain your vote to anyone. Other jurors can and will "tattle" on you to the judge, claiming you lied in voir dire. If you're accused of this, simply say nothing, or, at most, state that you told the truth during voir dire, but that "the prosecutor didn't convince me beyond a reasonable doubt" or "I think the prosecutor is lying." <b>(2) Support the total abolition of the government schools.</b> Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of abolishing government schooling and the coercive taxation that supports it. Encourage parents to home-school and to teach their children about jury independence by requiring their kids to read Clay Conrad's book "Jury Nullification: The Evolution of a Doctrine." The government schools have created an uneducated electorate, uneducated citizenry, uneducated Press, and uneducated Jury.  All of the prior together are considered "the Fourth Branch" of government, a branch that was supposed to be "We, The People," superior to the three branches of government that tend to be filled by power-seeking politicians. The government schools have created a servile populace that doesn't know the basic ideas of individual freedom, and has accepted a central bank as the top hierarchical branch of government power, when individual citizens themselves, as the Jury, are supposed to be higher than the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of government. Not one person in a thousand can tell you what a central bank debt bond is, how the Federal Reserve inflates the currency, or what their rights are as a juror. The prior pieces of knowledge were once considered "basic Civics knowledge," but the government phased out the class known as "Civics" in order to avoid teaching these basic subjects, and replaced it with "Social Studies," and "Government" ...two classes that both indoctrinate kids into being servile, obedient, easily-manipulated, Economically-illiterate Marxists, instead of independent, rebellious, rational, Economically-literate capitalists entrepreneurs. Moreover, even if you think the government schools are doing a good job, there's no reason why people shouldn't be required to bear the cost of educating their own kids. Why should people who responsibly decide that they cannot afford to educate a child be forced to pay for the education of other people's kids? It's even worse that the "educations" they're paying for actually aren't educations at all, but indoctrinations that create a freedom-illiterate jury and electorate that vote to violate their individual rights and strip them of their freedom in most elections and most jury trials.<b>(3) Support the reinstatement of proper jury-instruction language. Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of reinstating proper jury instruction language.</b> Prior to the year 1895, in every local county courthouse in America, judges would instruct jurors in criminal cases this way: "You, the citizens of the state of ____, have a right to vote your consciences, even if your consciences be in direct disagreement with the law. You you understand?" Those who said "No," were not considered to be mentally-competent, and were dismissed from the jury. (This was because, by answering "No," they were essentially admitting that they might be "sociopaths without consciences," and thereby willing to sentence an innocent person to punishment, since they had admitted that they had no concept of "right and wrong." By saying "No" to the prior question, they were admitting that they were incapable of moral judgment, thus placing the onus for their unwillingness to take responsibility for their own moral decision-making back in the hands of the court). This created juries that allowed the greatest explosion of wealth in human history: the industrial revolution, between 1870-1920. Then, in the year 1895, the case "Sparf and Hansen v. USA" went to the Supreme Court, and Sparf's lawyer argued that, because Sparf's jury (actually a military tribunal that constituted an improper trial that was conducted at Sea, on a Navy ship) was not properly-instructed to vote their consciences, that Sparf had not gotten a proper trial. The Supreme Court decided that Sparf's jury trial was legitimate, even though his pseudo-jury had not been properly-instructed. This sent the message to all the power-hungry judges in the lower courts: "You no longer have to properly-instruct the jury before the trial." The lower courts eventually substituted the following <i>question</i> in place of the old instruction: "Can you, the citizens of the state of ____, agree to apply the law, as I give it to you?" Those answering "Yes" are essentially admitting to the same lack of moral judgment and lack of independence of thought that the prior "No" reply was admitting to in the original instruction. Essentially, prospective jurors("veniremen") who reply "Yes" to the new wording of the jury instruction question are admitting to be mindless conformists who are mere puppets of the judge. ...But it gets even worse! The current practice is to seat all of the people who answer "Yes," but remove all of the people who answer "No," claiming that the new instruction question is "the final voir dire question." (But wait! "Voir dire" questions are asked by the prosecution! Why does the judge want to eliminate jurors who might be unfavorable to the prosecution? It seems the so-called "neutral arbiter" is actually on the side of one of the parties to the action: The prosecution!) It was only a matter of time, then, that the government schools would slowly stop educating citizen-jurors properly, without the "catch-all" formerly-provided by now-discontinued "proper jury instruction." In four states(IN, MD, OR, and NH), there is still proper jury instruction due to State Law, but prosecutors and judges simply eliminate independent-minded jurors with the pre-trial jury questioning known as "voir dire," by taking the prosecutor's side in the voir dire questioning process. For this reason, though restoring proper jury instruction is good, it cannot fully solve the problem of improper jury trial by itself, unless "voir dire" is also abolished.<b>(4) Personally support the abolition of bar-licensing. Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of abolishing bar-licensing.</b> Prior to bar-licensing, lawyers were not incentivized to act as though "all existing laws are legitimate." Though this was the view of most prosecutors, many defense attorneys encouraged "jury nullification of law" in defense of their clients. But now, bar-licensed attorneys are afraid that judges will initiate disbarment proceedings against them, stripping them of their government-granted permission or "license" to practice law, if they openly defy the law, and encourage the jury to nullify the law. Bar-licensing has thereby made defense attorneys subservient to judges and prosecutors in power. This has happened, very perversely, in the name of protecting defendants from hiring an incompetent or poorly-educated lawyer. ...The truth is that there is no protection from hiring a poorly-educted lawyer, and that bar-licensing simply makes the problem even worse, by reducing the total number of practicing lawyers, and thereby reducing competition among them for the best reputation for getting defendants acquitted. In 1832, the Ohio State Legislature implemented a form of bar-licensing requiring lawyers to possess a 4-year law degree. Abolitionist Lysander Spooner challenged this requirement in the courts as unconstitutional, and, before he could have the law declared unconstitutional, the legislature abolished it, as a means of saving face. Spooner himself wasn't bar-licensed, and his arguments overturned the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law in the North. Abraham Lincoln also wasn't bar-licensed, but he practiced law for many years prior to being elected president of the USA. There is no mandatory bar-licensing in Wisconsin, but that hasn't caused the sky to fall there, in spite of their court system being notoriously unjust and theft-based. <b>(5) Personally support the restoration of the Freedom of Speech inside courts of law. Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of reinstating freedom of speech inside the courtroom by outlawing judicial gag orders known as "motions in limine,"(Pronounced "Motions in Lim-Uh-Nay") and support a change to the law that disallows any silencing or judicial instruction that can suppress defense arguments selectively, based on their content. The defense should have the ability to argue against the law; argue that laws are unconstitutional; argue that laws are immoral, argue that laws are stupid or counter-productive; argue that laws cannot be fairly enforced, etc.</b> Judges can currently uphold a gag-order when the prosecution asks for one, or they create one themselves. This takes the form of selectively-disallowing certain defense arguments. If the defense lawyer ignores the gag order, they can be arbitrarily charged with "contempt of court," which sends them to jail for 30 days, and/or charges them a thousand-dollar fine. (The prior punishments happen if the "contempt of court" charge is not successfully fought as its own separate court case and beaten --which would generally mean that another judge from the same courthouse would be hearing the case, as if that didn't amount to a professional conflict-of-interest with a judge being socially and culturally pressured not to vote against his colleague as well as his own ability to issue "contempt of court" citations that he expects that judge to uphold). This is insanity. In the one place where freedom of speech is most important, judges now claim the right to threaten it by "disallowing" certain arguments. That's not their call to make. If a defendant believes any argument is indicative of innocent or guilt, it's not the place of the judge to insert his own opinion. If he does so, he's effectively taking the side of the prosecutor and no longer behaving as a neutral party, as the Constitution and common law both dictate that he must. If a judge issues a "motion in limine"(legalese for "judicial gag order") against a defendant or his attorney, vote "not guilty" regardless of the nature of the case. After all: you weren't allowed to hear the complete argument for the defendant's innocence. What if there were exacerbating circumstances such as corrupt government informants, as there likely were in the Ross Ulbricht case? When judges treat us as though we're too stupid to hear all the evidence, they insult our intelligence as the Fourth branch of government, and, because they are virtually all ex-prosecutors, their gag orders tend to favor the authoritarian arguments of politicians, prosecutors, and police.<b>(6) Personally support strengthening the Constitution's existing ban on "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" in the USA, (such punishment is already-prohibited by the 8th Amendment). Vote for and support candidates who campaign on a platform of ending the practice of high-stakes extortion using "cruel and unusual punishment," especially as resulting in undeserved prison sentences.</b> If you are a juror in such a case where the prior occurs, consider voting "not guilty" as a form of political protest, even if the law the defendant is charged with is legitimate, since you are being denied information necessary to make a judgment of guilt or innocence. Demand that all information about prosecution-offered plea bargains be admissible by the defense as constituting evidence of lack of a legitimate case, and an attempt at organized, criminal extortion. Support and vote for candidates who wish to strengthen the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by creating a "citizen review board" to bypass the prosecutors' office and use the citizen-jurors' power of grand jury "presentment" to present cases of prosecutorial abuse to the immediate next-in-time impaneled grand jury. This goal of preventing or, at least, disincentivizing cruel and unusual punishments can be pursued by demanding that (6a) all defense arguments against "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" always be allowed, whether they are moral, philosophical, legal, all of the prior, or entirely something else, in accordance with restoring absolute free speech in all courts. (6b) Demand that the practice of extorting grossly undeserved cruel and unusual punishments via plea bargains by threatening "a vastly cruel and unusual punishment that dramatically doesn't fit the crime" and then settling for "a lesser punishment that doesn't fit the crime" be discontinued, since all punishments that don't fit the crime are considered "cruel and unusual" under the language of the 8th Amendment and the common law as defined by "Jacob's New Law Dictionary" and "Black's Law Dictionary"(1st Edition), which were the two "common law" legal references at the time James Madison wrote the 8th Amendment prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishment." Allow prosecutors who are found guilty of such "High Stakes Plea Bargaining," to be prosecuted under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Statutes as organized criminal conspiracies, allowing them to be sued by wronged defendants in class action lawsuits.<b>(7) Personally support banning "high-stakes plea bargains," and revisiting all cases where such were used to coerce undeserved pleas.</b> Consider supporting candidates who campaign on a platform of allowing a maximum punishment of a $100 fine or "civil court restitution to be paid to specific, named victims or those victims' next-of-kin or dependents" for all "plea bargains" where no human life was lost. Consider banning prison time for nonviolent offenses, or supporting organized campaigns and campaign platforms that encourage voting "not guilty" until such reforms are made, and/or until all people serving "high-stakes" coerced sentences are pardoned under a "No High Stakes Plea Bargains and No Cruel Punishments" proposed law, due to the existing laws' severe abuse by prosecutors. Support candidates who campaign on a platform of pardoning and freeing existing prisoners, parolees, and those on probation who were victimized by coerced plea bargains. Support organized efforts to "refuse to vote guilty until the system outlaws high-stakes plea bargaining," either by instituting mandatory "maximum gaps" between the "offered plea bargain" and the "possible maximum punishment allowed by the law the defendant is charged with breaking," and-or by allowing prosecutors to be punished for cruel or inappropriate "threats of cruel and unusual punishment to extort or coerce an undeserved plea." Possibly ban "plea bargains" outright, since they encourage undeserved punishment, and discourage fact-finding trials. <b>(8) Support reinstating the common practice of Grand Jury Presentment.</b> Demand that Grand Juries are required to be opened to the general public, and made available to the general public for grand jury presentment, and support a change to the laws requiring the posting of the format for grand jury presentment on a public website, as well as requiring that the times when the grand jury is available to receive presentments from the general public be posted on a public website, and at and in front of the courthouse itself.</b> <b>(9) Reinstate the proper right of "habeas corpus" and the requirement of a valid, 2-part criminal corpus("corpus delicti") in all criminal prosecutions (and if such cannot be produced at any time during the trial, or pretrial, require that the case be dismissed, all charges dropped, and the judge and prosecutor be held criminally liable for the violation of constitutionally-guaranteed, individual rights).</b> Demand criminal prosecution of judges and prosecutors who deny the right of habeas corpus or its related requisite arguments and demands for the common-law-required two elements of a valid "corpus delicti" in court; or of prosecutors that fail to abide (by providing typed statements of <i>(9a) suspected injury</i> AND <i>(9b)suspected intent</i> AND <i>(9c)the specifically-identified party or parties identified as suspected of having been intentionally-injured by the specifically-named defendant</i>) by writs of habeas corpus within 24 hours of any arrest (or by the release of the prisoner and dismissal of charges).<b>(10) Demand that judges, police, and prosecutors be held accountable for enabling the legalized criminal practices like "civil asset forfeiture," using organized <i>political</i> jury nullification. Support the campaigns of politicians who demand the abolition of criminal practices like "already-mislabeled criminal cases" renamed "civil asset forfeiture." Demand full restitution for the existing victims of civil asset forfeiture and other forms of State-legalized theft, extortion, and denial of property rights; Demand the instantiation of automatic protections that disallow the conflation of criminal charges with civil charges(such as by claiming that the "injured party" in a criminal case is "all of society").</b> By adopting the Marxist doctrine of claiming that "all of society" can be the "injured party" in a criminal case, judges, prosecutors, and police have allowed the capitalist Constitutional Republic of America to be transitioned into a totalitarian Marxist regime. All jurors should completely refuse to give such a regime what it desires: the unlimited ability to punish the innocent. This raises the specter of "political nullification," as it was once used to protest the racist California law in the early 1900s that forbade Chinese people from testifying in court. Because this denied Chinese people the possibility of a fair trial (by denying them exculpatory witnesses who might declare that a murder was not a murder at all, but self-defense), white (classical) liberals did the only thing they could to force a change of the law: they refused to vote "guilty" in <i>all</i> court cases until the unjust law was repealed. This did, in fact, pardon many guilty murderers! ...And this is why "jury nullification of law" is portrayed as "having a dark side." However, the escalation in California was legitimate: the situation was totally unjust and unbearable. By denying the white victims of crime <i>justice</i>, the white voting majority were literally forced to stop ignoring the injustice being done to the Chinese minority. By so doing, the injustices created by pardoning the murderers of whites also allowed for the possibility of the injustices done to the Chinese to be given as the reason for those injustices. This "nuclear option" is a political option that actually builds violent escalating violent rebellion into the law. (For example, by jurors refusing to punish the murderers of police officers, until grotesque and criminal police "standards" that encourage theft, murder, and destruction are abolished.) In addition, this "nuclear option" of allowing injustice to go unpunished until illegitimate laws are abolished also serves to enlist elections as a solution that allows politicians to "save face." Political nullification adds a previously non-existent disincentive to majority voters ignoring status quo injustice, by extending status-quo injustice to the majoritarian voters, until they "get religion" on the subjects at hand. This "religion of freedom," is illuminated within this webpage, so to speak. Although the white majority in the USA might not normally care about the individual rights of the impoverished, the weak, the poor, and the racial minorities who are victimized by badge-shielded-and-emboldened totalitarian criminal cops, they often care when its their own families that are victimized by random criminals, and jurors say "We'd like to help, but our incredibly reasonable demands haven't yet been complied with, so now, you have to feel the pain felt by Philando Castile's girlfriend and daughter, and Daniel Shaver's wife, and Eric Garner's family." <b>(11) Threaten violent rebellion, if jury trials are abolished. The totalitarianism-desiring agents of the pathocratic state must know that the loss of jury trials will be understood to be an unacceptable "checkmate" that would certainly usher in a mass-murdering, democidal, totalitarian regime.</b> We have already lost a properly-functioning American "constitutional republic," and become the world's number one jailor. We can sink no further without literally becoming a modern version of Nazi Germany, or worse, a modern version of Marxist Soviet Russia or Maoist China (Both of which murdered over 50,0000,000 of their own innocent civilians during peactime, not including battle deaths in any war). Demand that judges, police, politicians, and prosecutors be held accountable for attempts to deny trial by jury entirely (such as by simply begining to pronouncing people guilty with no recourse to jury trial), using organized, armed <i>retaliatory</i> force. Do this only <i>if and when</i> the existing government successfully attempts to completely deny the right to trial by jury to the accused. This should be the announced "line in the sand" prior to an armed populace engaging in armed rebellion. ie: "This far, but no further! Don't Tread On Me!"</p>
      <p>The Constitution, though in many ways very good, was imperfect from its very beginning. For example, it appeared to endorse slavery, by insufficiently condemning and outlawing it, due to the political expediency of needing to enlist the Southern pro-slavery states in the battle for survival. (There were plenty of abolitionists at the time of the signing of the Constitution and Declaration. Thomas Paine and the entire Adams family, including Sam Adams were all abolitionists. Revolutionary war hero Tadeusz Koskiusko became an abolitionist when he read Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, stating that "the document was inconsistent with slavery," and encouraging Jefferson to follow his example, and free his slaves. He even coerced Jefferson into signing a pact to free his slaves, and then paid his entire American estate to Jefferson to do so. Jefferson reneged on the pact, and refused to free his slaves, who were callously sold to new owners.) Because bare survival is necessarily always a higher priority than individual freedom, the political judgment made some sense in the military context of the Revolutionary War, as an alliance with a vile ally in the interest of self-preservation. Even so, that alliance was acknowledged by the intellectually-consistent Founders as being inherently self-contradictory, so it shouldn't be worshiped as a piece of paper; other than for the ideas it contained that were consistently pro-freedom. For example: the Constitution, by noting that only armed men could expect to be free created the standard that "free men are capable of being armed, or cannot resist attempts to enslave them."</p>  
      <p>There may well have been no freedom for anyone if the Founders had not successfully rebelled against the British crown in 1776. Even so, by treating some human beings as property, the ideas of the Declaration of Independence were imperfectly-applied to the new American States. Luckily, the idea of jury independence was built into the Constitution, so that the individual moral judgement of the abolitionists could act as a veto on slavery and oppressions like "the Alien and Sedition Acts" from the very beginning, as such oppressions gained public notoriety in the Press.</p>
      <p>By 1802, jurors were frequently voting "not guilty" in cases where defendants clearly broke the law, but in which the public standards of decency disagreed with the law itself. The idea of "jury independence" is the means by which the individual ability to prevent the enforcement of unjust laws is built into constitutional "common law" itself. (The common law is the type of law that the Constitution references with such terms as "due process" in the Bill of Rights, and "habeas corpus," in Article 1, Section 9.) One case that tested whether "jury nullification of law" existed in the new republic was the 1804 case "The People Against Croswell." The Croswell case applied the "Rex(King) v. Zenger" 1735 standard of free speech to the new republic. ("Rex v. Zenger" was argued by defense attorney Andrew Hamilton, the highest-paid lawyer in Philadelphia, who defended newspaper publisher John Peter Zenger against a charge of "seditiously libeling" the then-royal-governor-of-New-York, William Cosby. "The People Against Croswell" was argued by defense attorney and "Founding Father" Alexander Hamilton, and used the same arguments that were used in the famous Zenger case, because Croswell was charged with the very similar charge of "seditiously libeling" then-president Thomas Jefferson. Both cases urged the jury to "nullify" or "ignore" the law by voting "not guilty," even though both defendants very clearly broke the law. By voting "not guilty" the jurors in these cases, and in a long line of preceding cases in England, established what is now called "the right of jury nullification.") </p>
      <p>Although western civilization was brought about by the power of the jury to nullify unjust implementations of the law, power-hugry judges, prosecutors, politicians, police, and government schoolteachers have always argued against the right to nullify the law. At this point, America has become a tyranny, because, just like in the North in the 1850s, judges are once-again instructing jurors that they have no right to independently judge the law, and are removing jurors who appear to be inclined to exercise their right to veto the law in the unconstitutional pre-trial "screening process" known as "voir dire"(this term is a gibberish legalese mixture of French and Latin, designed to bamboozle "prospective jurors" or "veniremen"). It is due to "voir dire" that jury-based governance has been most-degraded. The solution is simple: we should organize and educate each other to the extent necessary to defeat the "voir dire" prosecutorial stacking of the jury.</p>
      <p>Finally, the right of jury independence is a right that eliminate infighting among libertarians, capitalists, and other similar political variants of "classical liberalism." Those who wish to maximize "jury nullification of law" in victimless crime cases (the majority of the cases courts hear), are solid libertarians. Those who don't care about what happens to innocent defendants have chosen the side of the sociopathic, totalitarian police state, and cannot be considered to be libertarian, much less a specialized variant of libertarianism like "anarchist" or "minarchist." But it should be noted that <i>sufficiently radical</i> anarchists and <i>sufficiently radical</i> minarchists can both retain their core beliefs about the nature of government, in a coherent form, while seeking to maximize "jury nullificaiton of law." The right of jury independence is "anarchic" or "reductive of the existing power of government," but it is not "anarchist." Because the power of jury independence("jury nullification of law" applied only to victimless <i>non-crime</i> "cases") selectively reduces existing government power, it moves the existing totalitarian police state closer to both minarchy, and anarchy. At such a time that a government knows that, statistically, no jury will enforce any "victimless (non-)crime law," and ceases to make the attempt, that government might well be a "democratic minarchy,"(if taxation is 100% voluntary, and people still vote about how police power is allocated). Or, such a government may not be possible, because the total abolition of coercive taxation may be the last fight to be won, prior to the abolition of government, via jury independence and other means. Even if the latter is true, jury independence always seeks to place voluntaryists on juries who will seek to nullify the state's illegitimate laws. Even so, it's unlikely that a "voluntaryist anarchist" or "agorist" would nullify the punishment of a serial murderer, when faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt. For the prior reasons, anarchists and minarchists can work together to use jury </p>
