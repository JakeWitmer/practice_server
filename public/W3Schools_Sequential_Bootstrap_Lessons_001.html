      <h3>Equality Under the Law</h3>
      <h5>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are.</h5>
      <p>The law must not deny benefits that it confers to anyone, nor allow anyone to escape punishment that it might impose on anyone. This principle, throughout history, has tended to turn the people (with whom all true power resides) against the wealthy and powerful whenever the wealthy and powerful are given special privileges under the law that are denied to the poor and weak. This tendency first became prevalent when "the levellers," led by John "Freeborn John" Lilburne, significantly reduced the power of royalty in England, in the mid-1600s. The levellers sought to elevate serfs to the same level of legal property protections that the nobles enjoyed, and sought to reduce the ability of nobles and royalty to impose their will on others to the same level as the common elector, converting "inferior-under-the-law subjects" to "equal-under-the-law citizens."</p>
      <p> Contained within this principle is that those who are mighty or wealthy are not treated better, or made more able to manipulate the law, in any way, than the weakest or poorest citizen. This implies both strong democratic limits on government power (proper jury trials; a universally acknowledged right of habeas corpus) and weak democratic limits on government power (proper elections in which all parties have access to the ballot). Also contained within this principle is a rejection of false authority, which can be defined as "any authority which is not voluntarily acknowledged and accepted, by the judgment of those who accept it."</p>
      <p>There can be no royalty or "divine right of kings" when everyone is treated equally under the law. Further more, if everyone must be treated equally under the law, then anyone who calls attention to unequal treatment under the law must be taken seriously, and his claims investigated. If this happens, the law will tend to correct errors in its construction and administration, over time.</p>

    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h3>Prohibition of Coercion</h3>
      <h5>This is sometimes called "the golden rule" or "the non-aggression principle," and it prohibits the initiation of coercion(force, or the realistic threat of force) among human beings.</h5>
      <p>Early formulations of "prohibitions on the initiation of coercion" were religious commandments which were a precursor to philosophy, from which philosophy evolved. Foremost among them, "the golden rule"("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.") Thomas Paine, in a communication with Father Ray Suarez clarified this rule by adding its corollary, "the silver rule"("Don't do unto others what you don't want done to yourself."), which eliminated an ambiguity that had been exploited by sophists in the service of totalitarian rulers. (Prior to this advancement, authoritarian sophists successfully proclaimed that, because they didn't want to engage in vices personally, others should be harshly punished for doing so, because if they desired to engage in those vices, they would want themselves to be harshly punished. Realistically, this fails several tests of logical scrutiny, and should be rejected on moral and rational grounds.)</p>
      <p>Implicit in this idea is that taxation, to be moral, must be voluntary. If one judges the alleged "services" of government to be worthless, one must not be forced to pay for them. If a government cannot exist on voluntary support of its electorate, then it probably isn't a very good government. This view eliminates the argument between honest anarchists and honest minarchists. Both are fighting for the same thing: to eliminate the coercive powers of government. If people wish to pay taxes and participate in elections, they may do so, to determine how the police powers are to be allocated toward the investigation of crime and disincentivization or neutralization of various criminal threats.</p>

      <h3>Freedom of Speech</h3> 
      <h5>Without the freedom to communicate the pro-freedom ideas on this page, these ideas will tend to die out, over time.</h5>
      <p>Without active debate about how to best communicate pro-freedom ideas, and how best to prioritize their implementation, these ideas will fail to be phrased in such a way that they can be understood, and will fail to spread throughout society. The reason for this is that these ideas are dangerous to tyrants, so tyrants try to interfere with the teaching of them by knowledgeable adherents. If they can do that, only inept adherents and communicators will remain. Inept defenders of ideas discredit those ideas.</p>
      <p>The prior point about inept adherents is very important. One inept way of spreading ideas is to never place them into political contests that vye for political power. This signals to the poorly-educated (a majority of all electorates, worldwide, in 2017) that those ideas are not important enough to implement in material reality. After all, if one's philosophical ideas are good and true, then one owes it to himself to implement his philosophy. Since King Charles I attempted to silence John Milton, The English Levellers, and his successors tried to silence the Quaker religion and jury rights activists, political powers have tried to selectively silence freedom of communication while dishonestly claiming to support it.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it is of vital importance that every area that is open to the general public as a foot-traffic thoroughfare, and not used for some specialized purpose that requires the silence of all (such as a theater or library), be considered "open to free speech." Said another way: All of America is a "free speech zone," and the desire to limit free speech to "special zones," (outside of which, free speech is presumably to be violently opposed by armed police), is completely un-American and tyrannical. Because universities, in particular, have continuously tried to claim that petitioners and activists must be silenced or arrested until "approved,"(by which time, legally-binding petitioning periods have often passed their ballot access deadlines) or relegated to "free speech zones" (where there are too few people to hear them, or too few people to gather enough signatures for a political petition to be legally-binding), in order to suppress political speech, the claims of universities and public institutions to be capable of legitimately deciding where speech should be allowed should be viewed, by default, with both suspicion and contempt. A good heuristic or "general rule" is "if people can walk there, people can talk there."</p>
      <p> The work of "free speech absolutist" activists like Harvey Silverglate and Charles Alan Kors in "opening up universities" (to all viewpoints!) should be vigorously supported, as should the political free speech absolutist agenda of their organization, "the FIRE"(the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education).</p>

      <h3>Civil Disobedience</h3> 
      <h5>Laws that violate individual rights are unconstitutional and should be disobeyed. Those who break illegitimate laws are doing us all a favor by risking their own safety and comfort to stand against those laws, and we should all help them escape state punishment.</h5>
      <p>The law must apply exactly equally to all individuals, treating them all the exact same way, regardless of who they are. This idea was first put forward by both Henry David Thoreau and Lysander Spooner, who opposed the many already-existing unconstitutional laws of the 1800s. Thoreau wrote the political/philosophical "Resistance to Civil Government"(later retitled "On Civil Disobedience"), and Spooner wrote the legal theory essays "The Unconstitutionality of Slavery" and "An Essay on the Trial By Jury." Frederick Douglass was a great political popularizer of the prior ideas, and he fought and won the political battle to extend individual rights protections to then-enslaved black Americans, and the whites in the North who were a part of the resistance to slavery. After the Civil War, Douglass fought to enforce those rights protections against a still-racist Southern majority that had instituted local "Jim Crow" laws designed to target the newly-freed former slaves for legal persecution and denial of democratic participation. Thoreau, in his own way, encouraged the breaking of all pro-slavery laws, no matter their extent. This concept has come to be called "civil disobedience," and it is the foundation of western civilization that tests and breaks the unjust machinery of government, whenever it appears.</p>
      <p>Because laws exist that violate individual rights, due to the power-seeking of legislators and the lack of education of the electorate that fails to hold them accountable, two schools of thought have emerged. Thoreau, Spooner, and Douglass suggested that no individual is obligated to obey an unjust law, and that juries ought to acquit individuals who break unjust laws. This concept is called "jury nullification of law" by the organized totalitarian conspiracy called "bar-licensed attorneys," and "jury independence" by common American citizen-jurors. Because bar-licensing violates the principle of "equality under the law," by affording licensed attorneys special treatment by criminal courts that are denied to pro-se defendants (and their allies), bar-licensing is best seen as an unconstitutional tyranny.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h3>Jury Independence</h3> 
      <h5>Jury independence is the highest power citizens possess; it is the right to directly <i>nullify</i> unjust government laws by returning a "not guilty" verdict.</h5> 
      <p>Because not all laws are unjust, this concept is called "jury independence" because jurors can choose to apply or <i>uphold</i> just/moral/legitimate/constitutional government laws, according to (1) the context in which the agents of the government seek to apply them AND (2) one's own personal, independent, moral judgment or "right of conscience." Elitist bar-licensed lawyers ("attorneys") call "jury independence" by the name "jury nullification of law" because they know that this name is confusing to most non-lawyers, because it tends to get shortened down to "jury nullification" making it sound like the jury itself is what is being nullified. Via an organized political campaign of obfuscation, bar-licensed attorneys, politicians, and government schoolteachers have diminished public knowledge among citizen-jurors of the right to exercise "jury independence." In a drug case, gun case, tax-nonpayment case, prostitution case, or other case where the state is seeking to punish an innocent person for a non-crime, it makes a lot of sense to pretend to be obedient and servile (so you are not removed from the jury in the pre-trial questioning process known as "voir dire"), and then return a verdict of "not guilty" with no explanation. Even after the pre-trial screening process, you can now be removed from the jury and replaced with an "alternate juror," <i>especially</i> if you directly contradict what you said during "voir dire." However, the prosecutors and judges cannot force you to accept that the prosecutor is telling the truth (if they could, the jury wouldn't even deliberate, the judge would simply command them to return a certain verdict, as the "courts of star chamber" once did, in England, prior to 1638). The solution is simply to be a holdout "not guilty" vote, and refuse to explain your verdict, even if it "hangs the jury."</p>
      <p>There are 11 major ways that you can fight to restore jury independence: <b><br>(1) Directly and personally pursue the outcome of jury independence, if called to serve on a jury.</b> Make sure you get seated on the jury by answering the "voir dire" questions like an unthinking conformist (if you go first), or the "most similar possible" to the way the rest of the jurors answer the questions (if you are questioned after the others). State your willingness to apply the law if the defendant is guilty, but only if directly asked. Don't volunteer <i>any</i>information! ...just try to answer the questions as close to the way everyone else does. Judges want servile conformists on the jury. Don't follow those who grandstand and say they know their rights, etc. Be smarter than the prosecutors who try to suppress jury independence! Once you're seated on the jury, if it's a victimless non-crime, simply be a holdout "not guilty" vote, and do not explain your vote to anyone.<br><b>(2) Support the total abolition of the government schools.</b> Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of abolishing government schooling and the coercive taxation that supports it. Encourage parents to home-school and to teach their children about jury independence by requiring their kids to read Clay Conrad's book "Jury Nullification: The Evolution of a Doctrine." The government schools have created an uneducated electorate, uneducated citizenry, uneducated Press, and uneducated Jury. <br><b>(3) Support the reinstatement of proper jury-instruction language. Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of reinstating proper jury instruction language.</b> Prior to the year 1895, in every local county courthouse in America, judges would instruct jurors in criminal cases this way: "You, the citizens of the state of ____, have a right to vote your consciences, even if your consciences be in direct disagreement with the law. You you understand?" Those who said "No," were not considered to be mentally-competent enough to be jurors, given a proper understanding of Civics. The courts eventually substituted the following <i>question</i> in place of the old instruction: "Can you, the citizens of the state of ____, agree to apply the law, as I give it to you?" Those answering "Yes" are essentially admitting to the same lack of moral judgment and lack of independence of thought that the prior "No" reply was admitting to in the original instruction.<br><b>(4) Personally support the abolition of bar-licensing. Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of abolishing bar-licensing.</b> Prior to bar-licensing, lawyers were not incentivized to act as though "all existing laws are legitimate." Though this was the view of most prosecutors, many defense attorneys encouraged "jury nullification of law" in defense of their clients. We should return to that state of affairs. <br><b>(5) Personally support the restoration of the Freedom of Speech inside courts of law.</b> Support and vote for political candidates who campaign on a platform of reinstating freedom of speech inside the courtroom by outlawing judicial gag orders known as "motions in limine,"(Pronounced "Motions in Lim-Uh-Nay") and support a change to the law that disallows any silencing of arguments selectively, based on their content.<br><b>(6) Personally support strengthening the Constitution's existing ban on "Cruel and Unusual Punishments" in the USA, (such punishment is already-prohibited by the 8th Amendment). Vote for and support candidates who campaign on a platform of ending the practice of high-stakes extortion using "cruel and unusual punishment," especially as resulting in undeserved prison sentences.</b> If you are a juror in such a case where the prior occurs, consider voting "not guilty" as a form of political protest, even if the law the defendant is charged with is legitimate, since you are being denied information necessary to make a judgment of guilt or innocence. Demand that all information about prosecution-offered plea bargains be admissible by the defense as constituting evidence of lack of a legitimate case, and an attempt at organized, criminal extortion.<br><b>(7) Personally support banning "high-stakes plea bargains," and revisiting all cases where such were used to coerce undeserved pleas.</b> Consider supporting candidates who campaign on a platform of allowing a maximum punishment of a $100 fine or "civil court restitution to be paid to specific, named victims or those victims' next-of-kin or dependents" for all "plea bargains" where no human life was lost. Consider banning prison time for nonviolent offenses.<br><b>(8) Support reinstating the common practice of citizen-initiated Grand Jury Presentment.</b> Demand that Grand Juries are required to be opened to the general public, and made available to the general public for grand jury presentment, and support a change to the laws requiring the posting of the format for grand jury presentment on a public website, as well as requiring that the times when the grand jury is available to receive presentments from the general public be posted on a public website, and in front of the courthouse itself.<br><b>(9) Reinstate the proper right of "habeas corpus" and the requirement of a valid, 2-part criminal corpus("corpus delicti") in all criminal prosecutions.</b>If a 2-part "corpus" such cannot be produced at any time during the trial, or pretrial, require that the case be dismissed, all charges dropped, and the judge and prosecutor be held criminally liable for the violation of constitutionally-guaranteed, individual rights.<br><b>(10) Demand that judges, police, and prosecutors be held accountable for enabling the legalized criminal practices like "civil asset forfeiture," using organized <i>political</i> jury nullification.</b>  Support the campaigns of politicians who demand the abolition of criminal practices like "already-mislabeled criminal cases" renamed "civil asset forfeiture."Demand full restitution for the existing victims of civil asset forfeiture and other forms of State-legalized theft, extortion, and denial of property rights; Demand the instantiation of automatic protections that disallow the conflation of criminal charges with civil charges(such as by claiming that the "injured party" in a criminal case is "all of society"). By adopting the Marxist doctrine of claiming that "all of society" can be the "injured party" in a criminal case, judges, prosecutors, and police have allowed the capitalist Constitutional Republic of America to be transitioned into a totalitarian Marxist regime.</br><b>(11) Threaten violent rebellion, if jury trials are abolished.</b>The totalitarianism-desiring agents of the pathocratic state must know that the loss of jury trials will be understood to be an unacceptable "checkmate" that would certainly usher in a mass-murdering, democidal, totalitarian regime. We must send a strong message: "This far, but no further! Don't Tread On Me!"</p>
      <p>The Constitution, though in many ways very good, was imperfect from its very beginning. For example, it appeared to endorse slavery, by insufficiently condemning and outlawing it, due to the political expediency of needing to enlist the Southern pro-slavery states in the battle for survival. Even so, as long as jury trials existed in any form, that was enough to reduce the power of the state via organized "civil disobedience" and corresponding education of local jurors in sufficient numbers to nullify unjust laws. Once just 5% of jurors in a given "jury wheel" or "potential jury pool" disagree with a law <i>and</i> intend to nullify that law, the enforcement of that law becomes self-defeating for prosecutors (who wish to maintain a high conviction rate). The way this is calculated is by taking the percentage opposed to the law, as a decimal, subtracted from 1, and taken to the 12th power. So, with 5% opposed to a law and willing to nullify it, the odds of a prosecutor successfully prosecuting a breaker of that law are equal to: (.95^12) = (.5403) = approximately 54%. Prosecutors tend to drop charges against defendants when their odds of conviction drop below 60%, lest they lose public support and lose their jobs.</p>
